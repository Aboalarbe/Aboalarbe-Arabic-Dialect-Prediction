# Arabic-Dialect-Prediction

Twitter's popularity in the Middle East and North Africa is mirrored in its 164 million monthly active users, who send out a vast amount of Arabic tweets, much of which is in dialectal Arabic (DA). As a result, many scholars have turned to Twitter as a primary data source for contemporary linguistic and language issues. Despite the fact that Arabic is the most widely spoken language in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), numerous dialects of Arabic are spoken in different nations. While certain dialects may be very different from one another, we will use this information to create a classification model for Arabic dialects.
